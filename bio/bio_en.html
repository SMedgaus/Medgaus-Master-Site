					<h4>Becoming a person</h4>
					<div class="text-justify">
						<p>
							I was born on the 25th of August in 1995 in Donetsk, Ukraine. My parents are engineers and that fact influenced on me a lot. I was an ordinary kid in my childhood, moderately active and sociable. I liked playing Lego, constructing buildings, cars and other stuff using instructions, and then I create my own constructions of space ships and other fantastic vehicles.
						</p>
						<p>
							My elder brother <a href="http://masters.donntu.org/2011/fknt/medgaus/index.htm" target="_blank">Anton</a> greatly influenced on me. He shared with me his fascination for science fiction and fantasy books. We watched all popular fantasy films (e.g. Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and others) and, of course, we read books of Terry Pratchett, Robert Asprin, Christopher Paolini, Sergey Lukyanenko and many other good authors.
						</p>
						<p>
							When I was 6 years old I went to the school no. 99. In the primary school I actually didn't have a big desire to learn, but in the secondary school I have already understood how exciting school subjects are. I want to say a great thanks to my primary school teacher Elena Arhipenko and to my classroom teacher in secondary and high school for the inspiration for studying. I was fond of computer science and English, and thanks to my teachers Anastasia Shilko and Marina Cherkez for that.
						</p>
					</div>
					<h4>Becoming a professional</h4>
					<div class="text-justify">
						<p>
							By the choice of a specialty I went with full confidence that it should be associated with computers because I liked it. Attempts to engage in programming took place in high school, but at the level of attempts they remained at the time of admission. At school we mainly studied the package of office programs of MS Office and slightly affected the algorithmization and basics of programming in the form of the Logo language. Specialty <q>Software Engineering</q> I was advised by my brother and I am very grateful to him for that, because it entirely suits me.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was difficult to study during first courses, but very intriguing. I didn't have programming experience before entering the University, but Natalya Datsun gave us a strong base of knowledge of algorithmization.
						</p>
						<p>
							In that first year, our tutor on the basics of programming <a href="http://masters.donntu.org/2006/fvti/sereda/index.htm" target="_blank">Andrey Sereda</a> suggested our courseto take part in the competition at the olympic programming. I was curious and agreed to participate. As in the first year no one else dared, then I was put in team with <a href="http://masters.donntu.org/2016/fknt/bakun/index.htm" target="_blank">Bacun Ivan</a> (2nd year) and Artem Polyansky (3rd year) from our faculty. For them it was not the first Olympics, so it was a little easier for us. Unfortunately, we have not won prizes, but participation also brought satisfaction. In between competitions we were shown various workshops, interesting lectures, and even have tests for practice in the school from Binary Studio. In my first year I did not have enough knowledge for a decent participation and I decided that I would participate in the second year. In the second year because of my <q>advertising</q> a few guys from my group decided to participate for the second time, and this time we had team totally from our group. This time we also did not won a prize, but received a lot of positive emotions. Unfortunately, well-known events in Ukraine in 2014 marked the end of olympic programming in DonNU. Therefore, further small fascination with sports programming has moved to the online mode on the website <a href="http://acm.timus.ru/?locale=ru" target="_blank">Timus Online Judge</a>, where you can complete tasks from past competitions for your interest.
						</p>
						<p> 
							I was interested in all subjects, and it was hard to choose a theme for my bachelor's work. During studying <q>Software and data security</q> course I finally chose protection of programs' source code with obfuscation (changing source code saving functioning, but destroying easy readability for human). With the help of my scientific adviser Alla Chernyshova I created software system for obfuscating source code of JavaScript programs, and it was given excellent mark.
						</p>
						<p>
							To get a full high education I went to get a Master degree in my University. During my education I got interested in course <q>Neural network and fuzzy systems</q>. This is assoc. prof. Fedyaev's course, so he became my scientific adviser. After that we chose our theme work: <q>Program agents architecture and functioning in the multi-agent simulation model of graduates' employment</q>.
						</p>
						<h4>Goals, plans and vision of the future</h4>
						<div class="text-justify">
							<p>
								For the near future, my goal is simple and clear - to  defend successfully my master's work and get a master's degree. After graduation, I want to find a job related to the development of software for mobile devices under the Android OS.
							</p>
							<p>
								Concerning long-term plans, at this stage they are not clearly defined yet, but I want to take place as a professional in my field, to benefit the society by doing what I love.
